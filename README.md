Huffman coding implementation
=============================

This personal hobby project demonstrates the Huffman coding
algorithm in a practical implementation.
There is one program for compression and one for extraction.

The stuff that I have written is public domain.
The stuff that others wrote are in the lib directory.

Enjoy!
